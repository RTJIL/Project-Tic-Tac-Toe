# JavaScript Foundations Practice

Welcome to my **JavaScript Practice Playground** — a personal space to master some of the most important JS concepts. This repo includes simple, focused code examples for things like scopes, closures, and factory functions, all the way up to modular design with IIFEs.

---

## Concepts Covered

### 1. **Scopes**
Understand how variables behave in different blocks (global, function, and block scope).  
> _“What can I access, and where?”_

### 2. **Closures**
Functions that “remember” variables even after the outer function has finished.  
> _Used for private variables, counters, and powerful patterns._

### 3. **Factory Functions 🏭**
Functions that return new objects.  
> _Way cleaner than constructors. Easy to customize and scale._

### 4. **Object Shorthand Notation**
Create objects faster by skipping the redundancy.  
```js
const name = "Josh";
const user = { name }; // Instead of { name: name }
